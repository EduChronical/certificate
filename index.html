Create a PERFECTLY CLEAN, MESS-FREE, BLACK-AND-WHITE TECHNICAL PATENT LINE DRAWING for Fig.1 of a provisional patent. STRICTLY FOLLOW ALL RULES BELOW — NO EXCEPTIONS.

### DRAWING STYLE & FORMAT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Only solid black vector lines (1pt uniform thickness) on PURE WHITE BACKGROUND
- NO COLORS, NO SHADING, NO GRADIENTS, NO TEXTURES, NO 3D RENDERING, NO FILLS, NO FUZZY LINES, NO CLUTTER
- NO extra objects, no background elements, no random lines, no overlapping messy details
- Strict IPO / WIPO PCT patent illustration standard: minimal, precise, engineering draft
- Perfect ISOMETRIC PROJECTION ONLY (30° tilt on X-axis, 45° rotation on Z-axis; NO perspective distortion)
- Centered composition, balanced layout, large enough to see all details clearly
- Clean, small, sans-serif text labels ONLY (no fancy fonts, no large text, no overlapping labels)
- Bottom center: Bold, small title: "Fig.1 – Isometric View of Acetylated Agro-Waste Micro-Module (A²WMM)"

### SUBJECT: ACETYLATED AGRO-WASTE MICRO-MODULE (A²WMM) — EXACT DIMENSIONS & STRUCTURE
Draw a hollow rectangular micro-module with FIXED PROPORTIONS (15cm × 15cm × 7.5cm external size) — all lines straight, sharp, and aligned perfectly.

Draw EVERY structural feature BELOW, in order, with zero clutter:
1. MODULE MAIN BODY (Hollow Core)
   - Closed rectangular prism (isometric view)
   - Visible top face, front face, right-side face (3 faces only, clean lines)
   - Hollow interior implied (no messy inner lines; only outer structural lines)

2. 1.5° TAPERED DOVETAIL GEOMETRIC SELF-LOCKING INTERLOCK (GSLI) — CRITICAL FEATURE
   - LEFT SIDE: Male dovetail joint (straight, 1.5° precise taper, matching module height)
   - RIGHT SIDE: Female dovetail slot (exact matching 1.5° taper, clean recessed line)
   - No extra lines, no thickening, no distortion — sharp, symmetrical taper

3. PRE-FORMED UTILITY CHANNEL (For PEX/Copper Conduits)
   - Single HORIZONTAL dashed black line (uniform dashed pattern, thin)
   - Centered on the FRONT FACE of the module
   - Length = 2/3 of module width; no extra lines, no breaks

4. FOLD HINGE (For 4:1 Nesting)
   - Single thin vertical solid black line on the FRONT FACE (left-of-center)
   - Full height of module; simple, clean, no extra details

5. QR CARBON SEQUESTRATION TAG
   - Small, neat square (1/10th module size) on TOP-RIGHT CORNER of top face
   - Simple minimal QR grid (4×4 small squares, only a few filled black squares — NO messy dense QR code)
   - Clean square border, no extra lines

### TEXT LABELS (MINIMAL, NO CLUTTER, PLACED NEATLY NEXT TO FEATURES)
- Near male/female dovetail: "1.5° Taper GSLI"
- Near dashed line: "Utility Channel"
- Near vertical line: "Fold Hinge"
- Near small square: "QR Carbon Tag"
- Center above module: "A²WMM Module"
- All labels: Small, horizontal, non-overlapping, spaced out, no crowding

### FINAL HARD RULES TO AVOID MESS
- All lines: Sharp, straight, uniform thickness, no wobbly lines
- No overlapping lines, no extra decorative elements, no noise
- Only the 5 required structural features + minimal labels + bottom title
- Symmetrical, balanced, professional engineering patent diagram
- Zero errors, zero mess, zero extra details

Output only the clean line drawing — no extra text, no explanations, no borders around the image.
